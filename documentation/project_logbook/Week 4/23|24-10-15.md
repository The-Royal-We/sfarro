Working on sfarro through the evening.

Adding in flag now to recognise when any file is being written.

I should add in a method to pull out the latest time written. Also need to consider comparing time_t's against eachother
How much is 5 seconds in time_t???

Let's write the comparison operation

Another thing to consider is how i'm gonna monitor the time changes. Should I monitor at a set time-period? 
If I monitor on every read we could run into some serious overhead.

Writing comparison operators. Sure would be nice to pass some pointers around.
