Finally added testing to my project. The crux was that I was using C++ to run my unit tests.
    
    extern "C" {
        #include "timer.h"
    }
    
That solved all my linkage problems.

https://github.com/anastasiak2512/Calendar/ was responsible for helping fix this problem
 
Right my mutator methods for timer.h works as planned. How about writes?

Adding unit tests to the rewrite function.

http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/c_str/ is helping quite a bit for moving strings from cpp to 
c.
