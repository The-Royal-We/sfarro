Finally added testing to my project. The crux was that I was using C++ to run my unit tests.
    
    extern "C" {
        #include "timer.h"
    }
    
That solved all my linkage problems.

https://github.com/anastasiak2512/Calendar/ was responsible for helping fix this problem
 
Right my mutator methods for timer.h works as planned. How about rewrites?
