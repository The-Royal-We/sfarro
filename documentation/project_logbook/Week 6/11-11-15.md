Still adding test cases. Adding some for remount functionality.

I have to remove the global LAST_TIME_WRITTEN global variable, too much a pain in the ass. Using accessors and mutators
again. Moved the imports in remount.h into the ifdef block of the header file. Nice catching this now.

Removed LAST_TIME_WRITTEN from the header file and moved it into the source file...

Need to link in FUSE to the tests (WHY) https://cmake.org/Wiki/CMake_Useful_Variables.

So testing my thing gives me back
    
    #define EFAULT      14  /* Bad address */
