Right so it looks like using ruby to test sfarro seems like the SANEST way to do it. I have ruby installed proper so 
now the next thing I should be to write the functional tests for sfarro this way. Then I shuold have an automated
 way to ensure that I have code that verifies that all my requirements have been met in the code.
