Writing up test cases for my remount function. Looks like it isn't remounting correctly.

mount(2):

           MS_REMOUNT
                  Remount  an  existing  mount.   This  allows  you to change the mountflags and data of an existing mount without having to unmount and remount the file system.
                  source and target should be the same values specified in the initial mount() call; filesystemtype is ignored.
    
                  The following mountflags can be changed: MS_RDONLY, MS_SYNCHRONOUS, MS_MANDLOCK; before kernel 2.6.16, the following could  also  be  changed:  MS_NOATIME  and
                  MS_NODIRATIME; and, additionally, before kernel 2.4.10, the following could also be changed: MS_NOSUID, MS_NODEV, MS_NOEXEC.

My method was not being called correctly. Looks like I was passing in the mount flags as a wrong argument to mount(2).
Alright so i'm getting permission denied errors now from remounting. Need to brush up on my file permission stuff 
to order stand wtf i'm looking at.

mkdtemp(2) 

       The mkdtemp() function generates a uniquely named temporary directory from template.  The last six characters of template must be XXXXXX and these are replaced with a
       string that makes the directory name unique.  ***The directory is then created with permissions 0700***.  Since it will be modified, template must not be a string constant,
       but should be declared as a character array.
