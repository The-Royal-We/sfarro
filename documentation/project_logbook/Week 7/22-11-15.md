Forked a repository from https://github.com/mpartel/bindfs. This might give me a bit of insight onto how I can 
better use FUSE to remount filesystems.

Sfarro should rebind the mounted drive onto another device and do it's magic then. The problem surfaced up when I tested
the current iteration against what I would expect what would occur. 

Fuse mounts the folder using root, which is not what I want to happen as it interferes with the ability to remount it
to read only.

I need consider adding a source and destination mounts in my program.
