##Mounting
From command `man mount(8)`

       All  files  accessible  in a Unix system are arranged in one big tree, the file hierarchy, rooted at /.  These files can be spread out  over  several  devices.
       The  mount  command serves to attach the filesystem found on some device to the big file tree. Conversely, the umount(8) command will detach it again.

We can have a daemon that monitors whenever a pen drive is inserted into the pc.
What happens when a pendrive is mounted in a system??
Must investigate behavior when a pen-drive is inserted.
