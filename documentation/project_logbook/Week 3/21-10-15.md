Still walking down the rabbit hole that is this seg fault.
I'm lead to believe that the variable parameters that I pass into my log_msg() function is messing up somehow.
Also FUSE keeping sallowing my console outputs... Stop that
Aha! We're having trouble pulling out the logfile!

   FILE* logfile = VFS_DATA->logfile;
   SIGSEGV (Segmentation fault)
   
For some bizarre reason we're not loading in the logfile to the fuse context. It's logging the rootdir though

Ok. I fixed the problem.

ALWAYS USE ABSOLUTE PATHS
ALWAYS USE ABSOLUTE PATHS
ALWAYS USE ABSOLUTE PATHS

That's not everything though. Looks like it's not getting loaded at all to the fuse context
