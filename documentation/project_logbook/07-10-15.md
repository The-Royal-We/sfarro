Currently lacking the use cases for the project.
My guess at the moment is that when you mount a pen drive with a bootable linux distro on it you 
are limited by something unless it's mounted as read-only. That's an educated guess taken from what
I observe when the lecturer of CS424 does when he boots Debian off of his pen drive.

Decided to create a reading list to better track documentation
